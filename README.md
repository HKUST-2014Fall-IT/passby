# Firebase Chat Android Application

This application demonstrates using Firebase to power an Android
[ListView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html).
Firebase keeps the list data up to date, you simply need to provide a mapping
from your own model class to the View used to represent a list item.
In this case, we implement a simple chat application to demonstrate the functionality.
Create your own [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com), fork this repo, and incorporate the technique
into your own application.

Also, check out our [Quickstart guide](https://www.firebase.com/docs/java-quickstart.html) for more information on setting up the Firebase SDK on Android.
